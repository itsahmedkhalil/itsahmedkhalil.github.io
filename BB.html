  <h3>Background and Project Significance:</h3>
  <p>Bullying in schools is a worldwide problem that can have negative consequences on the general school climate and for the right of students to learn in a safe environment without fear. It is a serious problem that can dramatically affect the ability of students to progress academically and socially. </p>
    <p>Various reports and studies have established that approximately 15% of students are either bullied regularly or are initiators of bullying behavior (Olweus, 1993). Direct bullying seems to increase through the elementary years, peak in the middle school/junior high school years and decline during the high school years. However, while direct physical assault seems to decrease with age, verbal abuse appears to remain constant. School size, racial composition, and school setting (rural, suburban, or urban) do not seem to be distinguishing factors in predicting the occurrence of bullying.</p>
    <p>Oliver, Hoover, and Hazler (1994) surveyed students in the Midwest and found that a clear majority felt that victims were at least partially responsible for bringing the bullying on themselves. Students surveyed tended to agree that bullying toughened a weak person, and some felt that bullying "taught" victims appropriate behavior. Charach, Pepler, and Ziegler (1995) found that students considered victims to be "weak," "nerds," and "afraid to fight back." However, 43% of the students in this study said that they try to help the victim, 33% said that they should help but do not, and only 24% said that bullying was none of their business.
    </p>
  <h3>Idea:</h3>
  <p>While the bullying might not concern other students, it should be notified to the school’s personnel. We believe that the best solution to this problem is to develop a smart band. The smart band would have a single button which when pressed three times consecutively would alert all faculty members in the victim’s vicinity. The band would also have a built-in microphone which would automatically record any verbal bullying that might be targeted towards the victim as soon as the button is pressed three times. This feature would hopefully allow the school to make the appropriate disciplinary decisions with solid evidence.</p> 
    <p>We hope that this smart band could be incorporated for all ages, which would require it to be extremely durable. Given that this smart band would most likely run on at least one lithium polymer battery, the smart band would need to be rigid to prevent spontaneous combustion upon bending. The band would also need to be at least water resistant. Given all these requirements, the biggest challenge of this entire project will likely be creating a smart band that is cheap enough to meet the very low budget of most schools. </p>
    <p>Once the product is developed and can be produced at a relatively cheap price, there are many options we hope to add which mainly deal with RFID. The main two are attendance systems and payment systems. We believe that utilizing an attendance system to ensure that students are on time to their classes would not only increase teaching time but would also decrease the amount of time that students spend unsupervised by a faculty member. Utilizing a payment system into the smart band would allow the student’s guardians to directly deposit money onto the student’s watch – like a WISCARD. Students will then not be required to bring money with them to school which would hopefully prevent theft and bullying.

  <h3>Progress:</h3>
  <p>Mohamed and I worked on this project from August of 2020 until January of 2021. Throughout this period, we had created a prototype of the circuitry that would be used in the band.
